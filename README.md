# SlideShow

â€¦ is a Minecraft mod that adds a "Slide Show Projector" block. This block can project any online image into the world.

Simply right-click the block to open its GUI, take the slide item out,
open it and paste the URL to the image, then put it back into the block, and it will work! 
There are also several options to adjust; hover your mouse to these icons to get familiar with these options.
